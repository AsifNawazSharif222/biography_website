                    <blockquote><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (<span>/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ </span>

                            October 1931 – 27
                            July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from
                            2002
                            to
                            2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly
                            at
                            the
                            Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation
                            (ISRO)
                            and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile
                            development
                            efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
                            development
                            of
                            ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
                            organisational,
                            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                            the
                            original nuclear test by India in 1974.</span>
